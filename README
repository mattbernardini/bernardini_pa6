proc_fan
testsim

These programs are designed to work together.  Runsim.c creates proc_fan which is the creator process.
Testsim.c creates the child processes that are forked from runsim and have a timer.  These are dummy
processes simply ment to test the ability for a parent process to wait for a child.

TO USE:

./proc_fan -n [number of fans]
./proc_fan -h shows help message

EXAMPLE INVOCATION

./proc_fan -n 20 < testing.data

Requires:
    A file with commands in it to process, assumes that each line starts with the name of the command,
    and is followed by 2 numbers representing delays.  If there are any other commands past that they
    will not be processed.  This also assumes that the command to run is in the current working 
    directory.  If either the last 2 arguments are not numbers or the program the parent is trying to
    run is not in the current working directory then it will fail.
    
    An example line in the file would be "testsim 5 10" without quotes.
    
    This file should pipe commands to stdin in order for it to properly process the commands.

The exit status' are pulled from the system and do not nessecialrliy reflect the child exit status
